For the easiest experience I recommend downloading the GitHub desktop app from here:
https://desktop.github.com/

Here you must sign into your account to access the application's features, once in it look 
at the top tab of the screen. Go to File, then clone repository. Enter the link of our
repository: https://github.com/ColinK99/Team5_CSE3310_Game, then select the folder you want
the local repository to be located.

Now you have a local version of the repository, and are free to edit it however you want.
When you've finished with your work for the day, and are at an acceptable spot you will 
want to "commit to master" giving a brief description of your implementations.
(Be advised, this will take awhile, I'm working on a way to condense the file)

Once sent, it will be pending review, this is to review conflicting changes between multiple
different versions of the project. If two members codes are conflicting with each other, I'll 
be sure to contact both of you to find a way to consolidate the code. Be sure to be open about
what you're doing, i.e) Global variables you need consistent, assets that need to be implemented,
placeholder assets, etc. To ensure that minimal changes are needed.

Keep watch over the discord for updates and tips from members of the team.

Thank you for taking the time reading this,
here's to a good product!
