For the easiest experience I recommend downloading the GitHub desktop app from here:
https://desktop.github.com/

Here you must sign into your account to access the application's features, once in it look 
at the top tab of the screen. Go to File, then clone repository. Enter the link of our
repository: https://github.com/ColinK99/Team5_CSE3310_Game, then select the folder you want
the local repository to be located.

Now you have a local version of the repository, but you should not modify this branch, because any commits you make here
will affect the master branch and could cause serious issues. When you clone the master be sure to create your own branch 
of it on the "Branch" tab. This branch can be your branch exclusively and you can edit it however you want, naming it something like "YourName's_Branch."
Any changes you make to this branch will not affect the main document. However, when you feel you've added a lot of functionality
(i.e. A new function is working correctly, or you're straight up finished) Request to "Pull" your branch to master.
This is where you'll want to give a brief explanation of your implementation's and two other teammates will review it. With
two confirmations, the branch will be merged to master and then you can make a new branch of the updated code!

If the code concerns two members whose code depends on each other, I'll 
be sure to contact both of you to find a way to consolidate the code. Be sure to be open about
what you're doing, i.e) Global variables you need consistent, assets that need to be implemented,
placeholder assets, etc. To ensure that minimal changes are needed.

Keep watch over the discord for updates and tips from members of the team.

Thank you for taking the time reading this,
here's to a good product!
