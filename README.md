A few guidelines so that this project can run smoothly, and no compilation errors occur. 

Unity Engine Ver. 2019.3.4f1
***********************
Until further notice, we will be using Unity ver. 2019.3.4f1, we will be using only this version. Do not update your version of unity, or our game will not work properly. 
If you already have a newer version, you can create a snapshot of 2019.3.4f1 on the installs
tab on your Unity Hub.

Android Studio ( 27 API - 10.0 Q)
***********************
Until further notice, we will be using the SDK for Android (10.0 Q). Which is the latest
version. This follows the class guidelines and is the most stable.
